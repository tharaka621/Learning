package OOP_Inheritance;

/*
Using one Class all properties from a another class
Parent Class >>>>>>>> Child Class
to do this use 'extend' key word

there are five types of inheritance
    1.Single       : 1 parent , 1 child (A to B)
    2.Multilevel   : 1 parent , 1 child , 1 child (A to B) (B to C)
    3.Hierarchical : 1 Parent , several child (A to B , A to C)
    4.Multiple     : several parent, 1 child  (A to C , B to C)
    5.Hybrid       : Hierarchical + Multiple : (A to B , A to C) (B to D, C to D)

    1 , 2 & 3 types can be make using "class" concept (1 class can not extend several parent classes)
    4 & 5 types can be make using "interface" concept
